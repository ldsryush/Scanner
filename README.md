Relational Database Interpreter and Query System Developed a comprehensive project to interpret, evaluate, and query data based on a Datalog-inspired language, employing advanced programming techniques and algorithms:

Lexical Analysis: Implemented a scanner to tokenize input and identify syntactic elements, ensuring accurate parsing.

Syntax Parsing: Designed a parser to build structured representations of schemes, facts, rules, and queries.

Graph Construction: Created dependency graphs to represent rule relationships for efficient evaluation.
Database Management: Built classes to manage relations and tuples, supporting operations like selection, projection, renaming, and joining.

Rule and Query Evaluation: Engineered algorithms to iteratively evaluate rules and queries, demonstrating expertise in recursion and optimization.
